Hello there!!
Here is my first React Project which is A Social Media images application!

The posts are images, You can delete, share, save and download it!
Also there is a searchBar in which you can find out your favaorate images across different categories.
You have your profile, as well.
You can add your post  using the plus icon!

This project is done using the amazing React.JS features! Feel free to check out the code above.
Technologies used:
For Front-End: React.js, Tailwindcss.
For Back-End: I used a unified content platform (Sanity) which is a data store for your images and their details in which you can add, delete and fetch them.
