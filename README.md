This project is a full-stack social media app that focuses on high performance, reliability, and scalability. It utilizes various technologies such as React.js, Tailwind CSS, Sanity SQL, and Jest for unit testing. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of React.js, including hooks, linking, routing, and more, I've created a seamless user experience.

For the front-end development, I used React.js and Tailwind CSS. The back-end relies on Sanity, a unified content platform, to store and manage your photographs and their information. You have complete control over your posts - you can add, remove, and retrieve them as desired.

In addition, the app offers several features such as the ability to remove, share, save, and download photos. There's also a convenient search bar that allows you to explore your favorite images across various categories. Furthermore, you have your own profile where you can easily add new posts by clicking the "+" sign.
