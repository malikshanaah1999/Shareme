Hello there!!
Here is my first React Project which is A Social Media images application!

Full-Stack Social Media App: High-performance(Data migration), reliable, and scalable.
Used Technologies: React.js, Tailwindcss, Sanity SQL, Sanity: Unified Content Platform.-Jest: as a unit testing library.
This project makes use of the fantastic React.JS capabilities(Hooks, Linking & Routing, and many others) The following technologies were used: React.js and Tailwindcss for front-end development. I utilized a unified content platform (Sanity) for the back end, a data store for your photographs and their information that you can add, remove, and get.

You may remove, share, save, and download the postings since they are photos. There is also a searchBar where you may discover your favorite photographs from many categories. You, too, have a profile. You can add your post by clicking the + sign!
